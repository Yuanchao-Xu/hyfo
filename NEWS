hyfo 1.3.8
==========
Date: 2017-1-8

- add changes to the new version of roxygen2

hyfo 1.3.7
==========
Date: 2016-3-1

- add one more argument to plotTS, to cancel the marking of NA values. For some users, NA values are too many to be plotted.



hyfo 1.3.6
==========
Date: 2015-12-15

- transfer from ncdf to ncdf4
- grepAndMatch created, for capturing dimension names.
- minor bug fixed about the loadNcdf, when no dimension found, it will give an error indicating.
- change most of the match function into grepAndMatch, in order to deal with different dimension names.
- add name attributes to gridfile$xyCoords$x,y, when writeNcdf, the dim names will be taken from that attribute, which can be exactly the same with the original. 
- bug fixed for nc files without members.

NOTE:
====
- for hyfo$Data part, when load and write using ncdf4, there will be very little differences compared to the original, which cannot be addressed. If you first load an ncdf file, then write it, then load it again. The data part may have very little difference, less than 10E-5.
