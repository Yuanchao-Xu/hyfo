  "body": "## Welcome \r\n\r\nhyfo is an **R package**, initially designed for the European Project EUPORIAS, and cooperated with DHI Denmark, which was then extended to other uses in hydrology, hydraulics and climate. \r\n\r\nThis package mainly focuses on data processing and visulization in hydrology and climate forecasting. Main function includes NetCDF file processing, data extraction, data downscaling, data resampling, gap filler of precipitation, bias correction of forecasting data, flexible time series plot, and spatial map generation. It is a good pre-processing and post-processing tool for hydrological and hydraulic modellers.\r\n\r\n## User manual\r\n\r\npdf version [here](http://media.wix.com/ugd/199c69_f3c30d4625a545908b5c0f13e17f0b33.pdf), easier to download and looks better.\r\n\r\nhtml version [here](http://rpubs.com/rankthefirst/hyfo), easier to copy paste codes.\r\n\r\n## Installation\r\n\r\nFor released version:\r\n```{r}\r\ninstall.packages(\"hyfo\")\r\n```\r\n\r\nFor development version:\r\n```{r}\r\n  install.packages('devtools')\r\n  # Ignore the warning that Rtool is not installed, unless you want other function from devtools.\r\n  # If \"devtools\" is already installed in your computer, you can directly run the following code.\r\n  devtools::install_github('Yuanchao-Xu/hyfo')\r\n```\r\n\r\nIf you meet with some error during the installation of development version, e.g., \r\n```{r}\r\n  cannot remove prior installation of package 'XXX'\r\n  or\r\n  error in installation of XXX package.\r\n```\r\nIf so, just use `install.pakcages('xxx')` to reinstall XXX package. And then reinstall hyfo again. For other errors can be solved by directly reinstall hyfo.\r\n\r\n\r\nYou can also directly download \".tar.gz\" file from the link above, and install in an R IDE e.g. Rstudio. **Or** use the **Simpler** way to install the latest version. Rememberï¼Œyour R should be at least R 3.1.0.\r\n\r\n\r\n## Updates \r\n\r\nVersion 1.3.6 was released\r\n\r\n- transfer from ncdf to ncdf4\r\n- grepAndMatch created, for capturing dimension names.\r\n- minor bug fixed about the loadNcdf, when no dimension found, it will give an error indicating.\r\n- change most of the match function into grepAndMatch, in order to deal with different dimension names.\r\n- add name attributes to gridfile$xyCoords$x,y, when writeNcdf, the dim names will be taken from that attribute, which can be exactly the same with the original. \r\n- bug fixed for nc files without members.\r\n\r\nFor historical releases and the introduction of updates about each version, please click [here](https://github.com/Yuanchao-Xu/hyfo/releases) \r\n\r\n## Feedback\r\n\r\nAny bugs and suggestions are welcomed, please leave a comment [here](https://github.com/Yuanchao-Xu/hyfo/issues)",
