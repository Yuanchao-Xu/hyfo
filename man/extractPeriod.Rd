\title{Extract period from list or dataframe.}
\usage{
extractPeriod(datalist, startDate = NULL, endDate = NULL,
  commonPeriod = FALSE, dataframe = NULL, year = NULL, month = NULL)
}
\arguments{
\item{datalist}{A list of different dataframes of time series .}

\item{startDate}{A Date showing the start of the extract period, default as NULL, check details.}

\item{endDate}{A Date showing the end of the extract period, default as NULL, check details.}

\item{commonPeriod}{A boolean showing whether the common period is extracted. If chosen, startDate and endDate
should be NULL.}

\item{dataframe}{A dataframe with first column Date, the rest columns value. If your input is a
dataframe, not time series list, you can put \code{dataframe = yourdataframe}. And certain period will be
extracted. Note: if your input is a time series, that means all the columns share the same period of date.}

\item{year}{extract certain year in the entire time series. if you want to extract year 2000, set \code{year = 2000}}

\item{month}{extract certain months in a year. e.g. if you want to extract Jan, Feb of each year,
set \code{month = c(1, 2)}.}
}
\value{
A list or a dataframe with all the time series inside containing the same period.
}
\description{
Extract common period or certain period from a list of different dataframes of time series, or from a
dataframe.
NOTE: all the dates in the datalist should follow the format in ?as.Date{base}.
}
\details{
\strong{startDate and endDate}

If startDate and endDate are assigned, then certain period between startDate and endDate will be returned,
for both datalist input and dataframe input.

If startDate and endDate are NOT assigned, then,

   if input is a datalist, the startDate and endDate of the common period of different datalists will be assigned
   to the startDate and endDate.

   if input is a dataframe, the startDate and endDate of the input dataframe will be assigned to the startDate
   and endDate . Since different value columns share a common Date column in a dataframe input.

\strong{year and month}

For year crossing month input, hyfo will take from the year before. E.g. if \code{month = c(10, 11, 12, 1)},
and \code{year = 1999}, hyfo will take month 10, 11 and 12 from year 1998, and month 1 from 1999.You DO NOT
have to set \code{year = 1998 : 1999}.

Well, if you set \code{year = 1998 : 1999}, hyfo will take month 10, 11 and 12 from year 1997, and month 1 from 1998,
then, take month 10, 11 and 12 from year 1998, month 1 from 1999. So you only have to care about the latter year.
