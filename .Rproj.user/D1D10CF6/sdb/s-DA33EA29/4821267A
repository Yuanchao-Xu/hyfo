The correlation coefficient of every two columns (except time column) is calculated.\nthe correlation coefficient calculation can be based on 'daily', 'monthly', 'annual',\nin each case, the daily data, the monthly mean daily data and annual mean daily data of \neach column will be taken in the correlation calculation.\n\nThen the correlation matrix is got, then based on the matrix, for each column, \nthe 1st, 2nd, 3rd,... correlated column will be got. So if there is missing value in the\ncolumn, it will get data from orderly 1st, 2nd, 3rd column.\n\n 2. The  simple linear regress is calculated between every two columns. When generating the\n linear coefficient, the incept should be force to 0. i.e. y = a*x + b should be forec to \n y = a*x.\n \n 3. Gap filling. E.g., on a certain date, there is a missing value in column A, then the\n correlation order is column B, column C, column D, which means A should take values from\n B firstly, if B is also missing data, then C, then D.\n \n Assuming finally value from column C is taken. Then according to step 2, A = a*C, then the\n final value filled in column A is missing_in_A = a*value_in_C, a is the linear coeffcient.\n}\n\\examples{\nb <- read.table(text = '        Date  AAA  BBB  CCC  DDD  EEE\n49 1999-12-15 24.8 21.4 25.6 35.0 17.4\n50 1999-12-16   NA  0.6  1.5  6.3  2.5\n51 1999-12-17   NA 16.3 20.3  NA 19.2\n52 1999-12-18   13  1.6 NA  6.3  0.0\n53 1999-12-19   10 36.4 12.5 26.8 24.9\n54 1999-12-20   NA  0.0  0.0  0.2  0.0\n55 1999-12-21  0.2  0.0  0.0  0.0  0.0\n56 1999-12-22  0.0  0.0  0.0  0.0  0.0')\n\nb1 <- fillGap(b) # if corPeriod is missing, 'daily' is taken as default.\n\ndata(testdl)\na <- extractPeriod(testdl, commonPeriod = TRUE)\na1 <- list2Dataframe(a)\na2 <- fillGap(a1)\na3 <- fillGap(a1, corPeriod = 'monthly')\n\n\n# More examples can be found in the user manual on https://yuanchao-xu.github.io/hyfo/\n\n}\n\\references{\nGap fiiling method based on correlation and linear regression.\n\n\\itemize{\n\\item Hirsch, Robert M., et al. \"Statistical analysis of hydrologic data.\" Handbook of hydrology.
