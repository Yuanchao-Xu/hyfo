Check details for more information.}\n\n\\item{plot}{A string showing whether the plot will be shown, e.g., 'norm' means normal plot (without any process), \n'cum' means cummulative plot, default is 'norm'. For other words there will be no plot.}\n\n\\item{output}{A string showing which type of output you want. Default is \"data\", if \"ggplot\", the \ndata that can be directly plotted by ggplot2 will be returned, which is easier for you to make series\nplots afterwards. NOTE: If \\code{output = 'ggplot'}, the missing value in the data will\nbe replaced by \\code{mv}, if assigned, default mv is 0.}\n\n\\item{name}{If \\code{output = 'ggplot'}, name has to be assigned to your output, in order to differentiate\ndifferent outputs in the later multiplot using \\code{getEnsem_comb}.}\n\n\\item{mv}{A number showing representing the missing value. When calculating the cumulative value, \nmissing value will be replaced by mv, default is 0.}\n\n\\item{coord}{A coordinate of longitude and latitude. e.g. corrd = c(lon, lat). If coord is assigned,\ncell argument will no longer be used.}\n\n\\item{...}{\\code{title, x, y} showing the title and x and y axis of the plot. e.g. \\code{title = 'aaa'}}\n}\n\\value{\nA ensemble time series extracted from forecating data.\n}\n\\description{\ngetFrcEnsem extract timeseries from forecasting data, if forecasting data has a member session\nan ensemble time sereis will be returned, if forecasting data doesn't have a member session, a singe time\nseries will be returned.\n}\n\\details{\n\\code{cell} representing the location of the cell, NOTE: this location means the index of the cell,\nIT IS NOT THE LONGITUDE AND LATITUDE. e.g., \\code{cell = c(2, 3)}, the program will take the 2nd longitude\nand 3rd latitude, by the increasing order. Longitude comes first.\n\n\\code{name}\nAssuming you have two ggplot outputs, you want to plot them together. In this situation, you\nneed a name column to differentiate one ggplot output from the other. You can assigne this name\nby the argument directly, If name is not assigned and \\code{output = 'ggplot'} is selected, then\nthe system time will be selected as name column.\n}\n\\examples{\n\nfilePath <- system.file(\"extdata\", \"tnc.nc\", package = \"hyfo\")\n# Then if you don't know the variable name, you can use \\\\code{getNcdfVar} to get variable name\nvarname <- getNcdfVar(filePath)\nnc <- loadNcdf(filePath, varname)\na <- getFrcEnsem(nc)\n\n# If there is no member session in the dataset, a single time sereis will be extracted.\na1 <- getFrcEnsem(tgridData)\n\n\n# The default output is spatially averaged, if there are more than one cells in the dataset, \n# the mean value of the cells will be calculated. While if you are interested in special cell, \n# you can assign the cell value. You can also directly use longitude and latitude to extract \n# time series.\n\ngetSpatialMap(nc, 'mean')\na <- getFrcEnsem(nc, cell = c(6,2))\n\n# From the map, cell = c(6, 2) means lon = -1.4, lat = 43.2, so you can use corrd to locate\n# your research area and extract time series.\nb <- getFrcEnsem(nc, coord = c(-1.4, 43.2))\n\n\n# More examples can be found in the user manual on https://yuanchao-xu.github.io/hyfo/\n\n}\n\\references{\n\\itemize{\n\\item H.
