If you first load an ncdf file, then write it, then load it again. The data part may have very little difference, less than 10E-5.\n\n\n\nhyfo 1.3.5\n==========\nDate: 2015.12.6\n\n- travis check passed, change the rgdal version from 0.9-3 back to 0.8-16 due to the lack of packages on travis ubuntu.\n- changed .yml file to fix the problem with No repository set, so cyclic dependency check skipped.\n- on CRAN\n- fully supported for windows, Linux and OS.\n\n\n\nhyfo 1.3.3\n==========\nDate: 2015.11.27\n\n- Delete readData_folder, since it's only windows based, add information to get special version for windows users.\n- travis test added.\n\n\nhyfo 1.3.2\n==========\nDate: 2015.11.7\n\n- bug fixed about getPreciBar, signature('data.frame')\n- vignettes updated about bug and hided the warning information.\n- Add how to debug in the documentation for the generic functions.\n\n\n\nhyfo 1.3.1\n==========\nDate: 2015.11.3\n\n- new generic function biasCorrect, extractPeriod, resample, getAnnual, getPreciBar added. No need to designate input type any more, R will detect automatically.\n- coordinates conversion function extracted.\n- new user manual about real time bias correction and resample added.\n\n\n\nhyfo 1.2.9\n==========\nDate: 2015.10.30\n\n- new biasFactor S4 class added, to avoid set the input type every time.\n- operational bias correction has been changed to generic function.\n- news file added.\n\n\n\nhyfo 1.2.8\n==========\nDate: 2015.10.10\n\n- operational bias correction added, in normal function.",
